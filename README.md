# CSS Exercises

These exercises are a series of CSS related tasks intended to complement the HTML and CSS content on The Odin Project.

For each exercise we have three main components:

- README.md: exercise details
- index.html: attempted solution to the exercise (some might not be solved yet!)
- solution.html: suggested solution the exercise

## Viewing exercises

When I was going through these exercises I had a downloaded copy of the repo and used the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VSCode to view index.html and solution.html files. I also made use of VSCode's ability to preview Markdown files to read the `README.md` files.

I've deployed this repo to a [github page](https://shiraze.github.io/css-exercises/) so plan to have a link to all exercises on the [index page](https://shiraze.github.io/css-exercises/)

Thanks to https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/ for helping me make the Markdown pages viewable in github pages.
